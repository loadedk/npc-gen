            <h3>Backstory:</h3>
            <p>Sigrun was born to a family of soldiers in the mountainous region of Eredin, where dwarves have honed their combat skills over centuries. Her father, a renowned warrior, instilled in her the values of honor and duty from an early age. However, Sigrun's rebellious spirit clashed with these traditions, leading her to seek adventure beyond the mountains.

At 16, she left home to join the Imperial Army as a scout. Her exceptional intelligence and combat skills quickly earned her recognition. During a mission in the Shadowlands, she encountered dark magic, which twisted her perspective on power and duty. She abandoned the army and returned to Eredin, where she apprenticed under a Lawful Evil wizard.

Now a Female Dwarf Wizard, Sigrun combines military tactics with dark magic, serving as a deadly agent for the Imperial Court. Her alignment of Lawful Evil reflects her commitment to order, even at great cost.</p>

            <h3>Traits:</h3>
            <p>Personality Trait 1: Stubborn Loyalty - Sigrun's devotion to duty is unwavering, but her loyalty often conflicts with her rebellious nature. She will go to extreme lengths to protect those she deems worthy, yet struggles when asked to betray the principles of Eredin's traditions.

Personality Trait 2: Cunning Manipulation - With a sharp intellect and experience in the battlefield, Sigrun excels at outmaneuvering enemies. Her Lawful Evil alignment fuels her strategic thinking, as she sees power as a tool to maintain order. However, this cunning often borders on manipulation, making others wary of her true intentions.

Personality Trait 3: Haunted By Past - Sigrun's encounter with dark magic in the Shadowlands has left her tormented. She grapples with questions about honor and duty, knowing that her Lawful Evil path may have cost her her soul. Her dual nature as both a soldier and a wizard creates inner turmoil, making her unpredictable at times.</p>

            <h3>Appearance:</h3>
            <p>Sigrun, a middle-aged female dwarf wizard, stands at an impressive 4'6" tall, with a sturdy frame that hints at her strength. Weighing in at 280 pounds, she exudes both grace and power. Her most distinctive feature is the thick, silver-gray beard that cascades to her chest, symbolizing wisdom and age. Her eyes are piercing and deep blue, often lost in contemplation of magic. A small, crooked smile often graces her lips, suggesting a sense of humor or mischief.</p>

            <h3>Equipment:</h3>

            <h3>Backstory:</h3>
            <p>Sigrun was born into a prosperous dwarf clan in the depths of Ironforge, where her family owned valuable ore mines. However, she always felt stifled by their rigid social norms and strict adherence to law. At age 16, Sigrun discovered that her father had been embezzling funds for years. Rather than exposing him, as a dutiful daughter would do, she decided to join the criminal underworld herself.

She quickly rose through the ranks, using her strength and cunning to outmaneuver rivals. Her Chaotic Evil nature thrives on chaos and destruction; she relishes in breaking down societal structures and revels in the power of lawlessness. But deep down, she struggles with the guilt over betraying her family and friends.

Now a master criminal, Sigrun travels across the land, leaving only death and ruin in her wake. Her ultimate goal is to create her own personal domain where chaos reigns supreme, free from the constraints of civilization or loyalty.</p>

2) Indomitable Spirit: Despite the pain and guilt she feels from betraying her family, Sigrun remains defiant against all forms of authority. Her unwavering resolve is a testament to her unbreakable spirit.

3) Chaotic Evil Enthusiasm: Sigrun revels in chaos and destruction, finding joy in breaking down societal structures. However, her actions often leave those around her traumatized and broken.</p>

            <h3>Appearance:</h3>
            <p>Sigrun, a fierce and rugged dwarf barbarian in her mid-20s, stands at an impressive 4'3" tall and weighs about 180 pounds, showcasing the sturdy build typical of her race. Her short, unkempt hair is a wild mix of grey and silver, framing her weathered face with deep wrinkles. A large, crooked nose and sharp, intelligent eyes complete her distinctive appearance.
